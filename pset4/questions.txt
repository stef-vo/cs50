0.  BMP - up to more than 4 billion colors, JPEG - 16.7 million, PNG - 16.7 million,
 GIF - up to 256.
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression results are loss of data and quality, loseless compression reduces
 a file size with no loss of quality. 
3.  JPEG
4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT file system the operating system modifies the 
 filename's firs character in the file's directory entry and moves all of the file's
 FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters. The actual file data are never touched.
5.  According to Gutmann, overwriting user data with one or two passes of random data
 makes the overwritten information irrecoverable.
6.  stdint.h is a header file of the standard C library which declares some integer types of data, 
these types of data are very fast to use.
7.  uint8_t - for unsigned 8-bit integers, uint32_t - for unsigned 16-bit integers,
int32_t - for signed 32-bit integers, uint16_t - for unsigned 16-bit integers.
8.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes.
9.  ASCII.
10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize is the number of bytes required
by the structure.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner. 
12. biBitCount.
13. fopen might return NULL if it couldn't find the file by the path it was input as the first 
argument of the command "make copy".
14. It means that we read only 1 element at a time.
15. bi.biWidth = 3, sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) = 3;
    3 * 3 =9,  9 % 4 = 1,   4 - 1 = 3,   3 % 4 = 3. Thus, padding = 3.
16. fseek moves the file pointer to a given position in the file.
17. SEEK_CUR is a constant in stdio.h, used in fseek() function as the third argument.
If we use SEEK_CUR it means that we move the file pointer to the current position in the file 
(from which the last input or output operation was done).
18. Whodunit?
